# NBA Go

### ⚠️ Dead project ⚠️
#### Unluckily the NBA closed the official public API I was using, so app is no longer working. I used it daily to track results and players and worked properly until the API was closed (12/Nov 2022). I am insanely happy with myself for being able to complete this project :)

## What is NBA Go?
NBA Go is an NBA fan-made app, that shows realtime nba scoreboard with realtime player stats. It also includes a selectable date calendar to show all NBA games, a page to visualize east and west conferences standings and a player searcher screen (that can be filtered by teams and/or value) where we can check all the player NBA stats along its career.

## Why?
Well, this is actually a v2.0 app, I rewrote the app from scratch ([v1 code available here](https://github.com/JaysusM/Simple-NBA "v1 code available here")).
The v1 was created with Flutter Alpha version and with learning purposes without structured code. The reason I rewrote the app to prove myself and check what I learnt, I tried to write clean code, use architectural patterns (BLoC) and use app theming.
